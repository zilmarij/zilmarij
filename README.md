Iâ€™m zilmarij

My academic and professional interests revolve around Design and Optimisation of Computer Systems, chiefly, Computer Architecture, Computer Networks, Operating Systems, using Machine Learning. I am never closed to carrying out some transfer learning across domains that are relevant to my background  :bar_chart:

What also helps me out from time to time is alot of writing, reading and socialising :sparkles: :relaxed:
