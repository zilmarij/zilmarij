Iâ€™m zilmarij

I'm an MS(R) scholar at the CSE Department of IIT Delhi

My academic and professional interests revolve around Design and Optimisation of Computer Systems, chiefly, Computer Architecture, Computer Networks, Operating Systems, using Machine Learning. I am never closed to carrying out some transfer learning across domains that are relevant to my background  :bar_chart:


Creating programs out of concepts is my predilection, it almost feels like a whim brought to reality! :smiley:

What also helps me out from time to time is alot of writing, reading and socialising :sparkles: :relaxed:
